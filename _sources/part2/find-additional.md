# Finding Additional Sources

In addition to keyword searches, there are a number of techniques you can use to find additional literature that may help you answer your research question. To get a more complete picture, we recommend using these techniques only in addition to keyword-searching.

## Recap Standard Practice: Citation-Based Searching

A common technique to find additional papers is looking at the citations of relevant article to find related information (“snowballing”). Depending on who cites an article, or who the article cites, there may be relevant information present. Learn more about basic snowballing techniques in this video:

## AI Assist 1: Literature Mapping

AI tools can aid finding additional literature in multiple ways. There are AI-tools that can support this process by helping you explore the literature around a key article. To use this technique effectively, it helps to start with identifying a **reliable and relevant key article** for your specific research question. A literature mapping tool subsequently finds additional articles based on the references of the initial source you provided.

For example, with Litmaps you can get an overview of who has cited and who is cited by the article. Via ConnectedPapers you can get a map of prior works and derivative works, and it also creates maps based on semantic similarity. ResearchRabbit can map and visualise different citations and authors.

**Tool Suggestions**: Research Rabbit, Connected Papers, Litmaps, Inciteful

**Step 1: Upload a Key Article**
- Start with a key article in your field—one you already know is useful.
- Upload the article to the Literature Mapping tool
- Explore the network of **citing** and **cited** papers the tool suggests.

**Step 2: Reflect on the Results**
Questions to guide your exploration:
- How do the results compare to the results of your keyword search strategy?
- What additional articles seem promising?
- Are any of them newer or from different disciplines?

```

## AI Assist 2: Semantic Searching

In addition to citation searching, there are new AI-assisted search techniques emerging alongside traditional keyword-searching that can help you find additional information. Academic tools like Elicit and SciSpace use semantic searching to find papers. The tools search semantic scholar and retrieve articles where the language used best matches the language of a query written in natural language. 

This technology can be used to find papers in addition to those found through a keyword search. You can use these tools by simply putting in your research question and ask it to find relevant peer-reviewed articles. 

A lot of these tools also offer possibilities to build further on the information you found, by connecting it to citations or similar results.

```{admonition} Guided Activity: Semantic Searching
:class: dropdown tip

**Tool suggestion**: Elicit

**Step 1: Enter Your Research Question**
- Enter your research question (not just keywords!) in the semantic search bar.
- Review the top results returned.

**Step 2: Explore the results**
- Select 1-2 promising articles from Elicit
- Use Elicit’s follow-up questions or search features to: explore related literature ("search citation trails") or map the paper’s structure (add columns for methods, outcomes, claims).

**Step 3: Reflect on the Outcomes**:
How do the results compare to the results of your keyword search strategy?
Are the additional articles helpful?
What other things do you notice about your results?
```

## AI Assist 3: Agent-Based Searching

Instead of just looking for keyword matches, agent-based searching techniques use a combination of semantic and keyword searching and then ask an LLM to rate the relevance of the results. It imitates iterative searching and as a result finds more hidden papers. It can take a long time (about 3 minutes) to run a search. This approach can be an interesting addition for researchers looking for highly specific papers. Example tools are Ai2 Paper Finder, Future House Platform and Undermind.ai

```{admonition} Guided Activity: Agent-Based Searching
:class: dropdown tip

**Tool suggestion**: Undermind.ai

**Step 1: Enter Your Research Question**
- Enter your research question into the chat-based interface.
- Chat with Undermind to refine your query before searching for literature

**Step 2: Reflect on the Results**
- How do the results compare to the results of your keyword search strategy?
- Are the articles high-quality and/or peer-reviewed?
- Do the summaries seem reliable or overly generic?
