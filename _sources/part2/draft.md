# Drafting Your Text

When you’ve found the literature you need and you’ve analysed your sources, it’s time to start drafting your text. In this step, you have to do most of the work yourself. Not only is there a big risk of inaccuracies in your text if you outsource this step to a GenAI tool, drafting the text yourself is very helpful in organising your thoughts and get an even better understanding of the topic you’re working on. There are however some elements that AI can assist you with.

## Recap Standard Practice: Drafting Your Text

There is not just one standard practice when it comes to drafting a text. Some writers prefer to start creating a detailed outline of their text before they start writing, while others prefer to just start writing and (re)structure the text later. Some people start with the introduction, while others first write the results or conclusion and save the introduction for last. There is no right or wrong here, as long as you find a strategy that fits you (and as long as you end up with a text that meets the requirements you were given).

If you would like to know more about different writing strategies, different scientific text genres, structuring or writing a scientific text, please consult <a href="https://brightspace-cc.tudelft.nl/course/2901/tu-write" target="_blank">TU Write</a>.

## AI Assist 1: Creating an Outline

As mentioned, some people prefer to first make an outline, before they start writing. General AI tools can be very useful when it comes to creating an outline. When you have to write a scientific text, the main structure is often already decided on: in most cases you will follow the IMRD framework (Introduction, Method, Results, Discussion), or the journal you are writing for has specific instructions regarding the structure (or during your studies: the structure is often specified in the assignment description). General GenAI tools can assist you in further developing the structure of your text.

```{admonition} Example Prompt
:class: dropdown note 
You are a [X year] student in [study]. You are writing a literature review paper about [topic]. Your research question is: [research question]. The text has to follow the IMRD structure. Create a detailed structure overview for the literature review paper and define for each section what could be discussed.
```

```{admonition} Guided Activity: Use General AI Tools to Create an Outline
:class: dropdown tip

**Step 1.** Choose **two** of the following general AI-tools:
- Copilot 
- ChatGPT
- Perplexity
- Gemini
- Claude

**Step 2.** Ask both tools the same question. You can use the following example prompt (and adjust where necessary):

_You are a [X year] student in [study]. You are writing a literature review paper about [topic]. Your research question is: [research question]. The text has to follow the IMRD structure. Create a detailed structure overview for the literature review paper and define for each section what could be discussed._

**Step 3.** Compare and evaluate the outcome:
- What are the main similarities and differences between the two suggested outlines?
- Which suggestions are useful for your text (and which are not)?

**Step 4.** Based on the suggestions from the AI tools, decide on a (preliminary) structure for your text.

## AI Assist 2: Using GenAI as Sparring Partner to Create Stronger Arguments

If you have written some paragraphs or sections, and you are uncertain whether your arguments make sense, you can ask an AI tool to ask critical questions about your text. Most general AI tools, like Copilot or ChatGPT, are suitable for this purpose. You could consider using the deep reasoning mode of the AI that you’re using (if it has one) for better results (but note that this requires a lot more energy to process). 

Using GenAI as sparring partner may help you to find the flaws in your reasoning and create stronger arguments. Note that, although the models are improving, LLMs don’t stand out for their reasoning skills. It is therefore advised to not use GenAI tools to generate arguments for you. As a critical sparring partner, however, Gen AI tools can give you good advice to strengthen your arguments.

```{admonition} Example Prompt
:class: dropdown note 
You are an expert on [topic]. Below you can find a section from my literature review about [topic]. Formulate critical questions about and possible counterarguments against the arguments in the section. For each critical question or counterargument, explain in a short paragraph (3-4 sentences) how my argument can be strengthened to anticipate this critical question or counterargument. Present the critical questions and counterarguments with explanations in a numbered list.
```

```{admonition} Guided Activity: Strenghten Your Arguments with GenAI Tools
:class: dropdown tip

**Step 1.** Choose a general AI-tools, for example Copilot, ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini or Claude. Check if this tool has a deep reasoning mode and decide for yourself whether you want to use this or not.

**Step 2.** Select a section from your text, preferably a section that you have some doubts about.

**Step 3.** Ask the AI to develop critical questions and counterarguments. You can use the following prompt (and adjust it where necessary):

_You are an expert on [topic]. Below you can find a section from my literature review about [topic]. Formulate critical questions about and possible counterarguments against the arguments in the section. For each critical question or counterargument, explain in a short paragraph (3-4 sentences) how my argument can be strengthened to anticipate this critical question or counterargument. Present the critical questions and counterarguments with explanations in a numbered list._

Step 4: Evaluate the outcome:
- Which critical questions and counterarguments are useful to improve your text?
- Are the suggestions that the tool gave you to anticipate these questions and counterarguments helpful?
- If necessary, ask the AI follow-up questions about the suggestions it gave.
Step 5: Improve your text based on the outcome of the previous steps.
