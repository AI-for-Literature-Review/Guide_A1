# Brainstorming on Your Topic

When you are just getting started with your research project, you might be in need of a general explanation of a topic. After all, you first need to decide on what exactly you want to research. In order to do so, you have to gather some interesting possible research directions.

## Recap Standard Practice: Searching General Databases

Common resources to start your brainstorming process include:
- Wikipedia
- Google
- Nexis Uni for newspaper articles

You can also write down any interesting terms or particular topics in a concept map.

## AI Assist: General Searches on Your Topic

AI can assist you: You can ask a general AI tool a question to get a feel for your topic. Use it in the same way you would use Google or Wikipedia. You can use the same question in multiple AI tools to see what they have to say and how they compare. 

There are different AI tools that can be used for this goal: When you use general AI tools in this manner, it is good to note whether a tool is connected to the internet. Models that are not connected to internet may hallucinate.  It can be helpful to use at least two models to do a general search so you can compare the information and potentially also get some different directions to look into. 

```{admonition} Example Prompt
:class: dropdown note

You are a [x year] student in [study]. You have to write a literature review paper about [general topic]. Suggest five possible research directions, each with a short description (3-4 sentences) explaining why the topic is relevant and what kinds of research questions could be explored. Present the suggestions as a numbered list.
```

To provide more context, you could also add some information in your prompt and ask the model to provide you with some directions to look into. For example, upload an open-source report or a topic description to make this more specific.

```{admonition} Example Prompt
:class: dropdown note

You are a [x year] student in [study]. You have to write a literature review paper about [general topic].
Based on the information below and general knowledge about the topic, suggest five possible research directions, each with a short description (3-4 sentences) explaining why the topic is relevant and what kinds of research questions could be explored. 
Present the suggestions as a numbered list.<br>
[information about the topic]
```

As of February 2025 many of a lot of general AI tools have added the option to do more detailed research, called **deep research**. This process is often more time consuming, and for a simple brainstorm it can be enough to ask a question to a basic model, rather than asking for a detailed review, but this is something you can explore for yourself!

```{admonition} Guided Activity: Explore General AI Tools for Brainstorming
:class: dropdown tip

Choose **two** of the following general AI tools:
- Copilot
- Gemini
- ChatGPT
- Claude
- Perplexity

**Step 1: Prompt**

Ask both tools the same question:

_You are a [x year] student in [study]. You have to write a literature review paper about [general topic]. Suggest five possible research directions, each with a short description (3-4 sentences) explaining why the topic is relevant and what kinds of research questions could be explored. Present the suggestions as a numbered list._

**Step 2: Compare Results**
- Which ideas seem relevant or surprising?

**Step 3: Deep Dive** (if the tool allows this)
Ask **one** of the tools:

_You are a [x year] student in [study]. You have to write a literature review paper about [general topic]. Suggest five possible research directions, each with a short description (3-4 sentences) explaining why the topic is relevant and what kinds of research questions could be explored. Present the suggestions as a numbered list._

**Step 4: Reflect**
- How long does the process take?
- Is the response more detailed or better structured?
- Do you trust the results? Why or why not?
