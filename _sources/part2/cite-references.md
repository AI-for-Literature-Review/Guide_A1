# Citing Sources

A very important step in writing a literature review (or any scientific paper), is to correctly refer to the sources that you used. After all, you have to give credits to whom they are due, especially in academia.

## Recap Standard Practice: Citing Sources

When you are working with a limited number of sources, you should consult the guidelines of the particular citation style and format your references accordingly, both in the text and in the reference list. For students at TU Delft, using the <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/tulib/apa-citation-examples" target=_blank>APA Citation Table</a> can support you in formatting your references in the right way.

If you are working with a large amount of sources, it is efficient to use a reference manager to manage and cite your sources in the format of your choice. Have a look at this video to learn more about how to use these tools:

## AI-Assist: Ask General AI Tools to Check Your References
You can ask general AI tools to check if you have used the correct formatting throughout your text, and give suggestions for improvement.

```{admonition} Example Prompt
:class: dropdown note 
You are a scientific editor. Attached is a draft literature review paper. The references and the reference list should be formatted in the [style e.g. APA / IEEE] style. Check if the in-text references and reference list are formatted correctly. Put any incorrect references in a bulletted list, including the location in the document where the reference is listed and suggestions for improvement.<br>
[attach literature review]
```

```{admonition} Guided Activity: Ask general AI-tools to check your references
:class: dropdown tip

**Tool suggestions**: Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini  

**Step 1: Prepare Your Document**  
- Select a draft version of your paper or literature review that already includes in-text references and a reference list.  

**Step 2: Prompt the AI Tool**  
Use the following template to guide the AI:  

_You are a scientific editor. Attached is a draft literature review paper. The references and the reference list should be formatted in the [style e.g. APA / IEEE] style. Check if the in-text references and reference list are formatted correctly. Put any incorrect references in a bulletted list, including the location in the document where the reference is listed and suggestions for improvement.<br>[attach literature review]_

**Step 3: Review the Output**  
- Check the AI’s feedback carefully.  
- Note which references it flagged as incorrect or inconsistent.  
- Compare the suggestions with the official guidelines for your chosen style (APA, IEEE, Chicago, etc.).  

**Step 4: Revise Your References**  
- Apply corrections to your draft document.  
- Cross-check the formatting again against the style manual or a reference management tool.  

**Step 5: Reflect on the Outcomes**  
- How accurate and useful was the AI’s feedback?  
- Did it catch mistakes you had overlooked?  
- Were there any false positives or incorrect suggestions?
