# Exploring Academic Literature

Once you've defined your topic a bit more and understand the basic concepts, it can be helpful to get an initial overview of the academic literature already written about your topic. This helps you to get a better understanding of the research field, and you can find out what research gaps still exist.

## Recap Standard Practice: Topic-Level Searching

What are some key directions already taken? A common approach is to do topic-level searches in academic databases like Scopus, Dimensions or Web of Science, or look specifically for review articles. Check the titles, abstracts and keywords of documents you find useful.
It can be helpful to look for specific review articles around your topic.

Do you want to do a more detailed mapping of academic literature? You could use the <a href="https://www.vosviewer.com/getting-started" target="_blank">VOSviewer</a>, a tool created by Leiden University. The VOSviewer is embedded in the Dimensions database, but also works as standalone software to which you can upload references. You can use the VOSviewer to make an overview of common terms that are mentioned in the academic literature for your topic or subject area.

## AI Assist: Exploring Academic Literature with AI Research Tools 

You can use academic AI tools to support this process. For example, they can help to get some initial studies and directions in the field. Examples of tools you could use for this purpose are Consensus, Perplexity pro or Elicit.

- <a href="https://consensus.app/" target="_blank">Consensus</a>
- <a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/pro" target="_blank">Perplexity Pro</a>
- <a href="https://elicit.org/" target="_blank">Elicit</a>

Each tool has different strengths:
- **Consensus** can map literature, but also answer yes/no research questions based on academic literature.
- **Perplexity Pro** combines broad web and academic search with citations.
- **Elicit** provides semantic search and summarisation from Semantic Scholar.

```{note}
Academic tools will often ask you to create an account, and will provide you with a limited amount of free queries. It is therefore good to be purposeful when using these tools.
```

Research tools like Consensus, Elicit, and the pro-version of Perplexity search open access scientific literature. Often their source base is <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org" target="_blank">Semantic Scholar</a>. Results from these academic AI tools therefore can miss non-open access sources found in traditional databases like Web of Science, Scopus and Dimensions.

You can use these tools to find key research questions to explore in your topic:

```{admonition} Example Prompt
:class: dropdown note

You are a researcher in the field of [your field]. 
You have to write a literature review paper about [general topic].
Suggest five possible research directions, each with a short description (3-4 sentences) explaining why the topic is relevant and what kinds of research questions could be explored. 
Present the suggestions as a numbered list.
```

You can also ask the tools to find some key research articles in your field you can then use to orientate yourself:

```{admonition} Example Prompt
:class: dropdown note
You are a researcher in the field of [your field]. 
You have to write a literature review paper about [general topic]. 
Please suggest 4-5 key research articles, each with a short description (3-4 sentences) explaining why the article is a key article for this topic
```

Finally, you can ask direct research questions to the tool and see what sources come up in the academic literature. 


```{admonition} Example Prompt (for Consensus)
:class: dropdown note

Does [topic] affect [variable/outcome]?
```

```{admonition} Guided Activity: Explore Academic Literature with AI
:class: dropdown tip

Use this activity to practice using **academic GenAI tools** for exploring academic literature.

**Step 1: Choose Your Tool**

Select one of the following academic AI tools:

- Consensus
- Perplexity Pro
- Elicit

**Step 2: Prompt the Tool**

Try using one of the following prompts in your tool of choice. You can substitute your own research topic:

Prompt 1:

_You are a researcher in the field of [your field]. 
You have to write a literature review paper about [general topic].
Suggest five possible research directions, each with a short description (3-4 sentences) explaining why the topic is relevant and what kinds of research questions could be explored. 
Present the suggestions as a numbered list._

Prompt 2:

_You are a researcher in the field of [your field]. 
You have to write a literature review paper about [general topic]. 
Please suggest 4-5 key research articles, each with a short description (3-4 sentences) explaining why the article is a key article for this topic_

Prompt 3 (for Consensus):

_Does [topic] affect [variable/outcome]?_

**Step 3: Reflect on the Output**

Answer these three short reflection questions after trying the tool:

- Were the results relevant and trustworthy?  
- Did the tool provide real, useful sources?  
- What do the results from the tool add to your initial exploration?

```
