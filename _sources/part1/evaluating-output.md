# Summary Part 1: Effective and Responsible GenAI Use

For effective and responsible GenAI use, keep the following five principles in mind:

1.	**Prompt**: Effective GenAI use starts with an effective prompt. Make your prompt specific, using (relevant elements from) the format: clear task-description + persona + context + format + tone + exemplars
2.	**Proof**: Always check the output for inaccuracies and biases. Critically evaluate the quality of the output, using your own critical thinking skills.
3.	**Privacy (and other considerations)**: There are many unknowns about how GenAI tools use your input. Never feed personal details or confidential information to GenAI tools. Also consider the environmental impact of GenAI before using it.
4.	**Presentation**: GenAI tools may generate grammatically correct sentences, but the output is often generic and flavourless. Donâ€™t forget about your own voice when you are writing a text.
5.	**Property**: In the end, always remember that you are responsible for your work, also when you use GenAI.
